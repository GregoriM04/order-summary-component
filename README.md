## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I am just getting more comfy with the results I have been achiving so far; so, I just kept practicing positioning elements inside the document and feeling so proud of the outcome I have had.

### Continued development

I need to continue working on making easy things even easier code; I know that every challenge has its own complexity and my code is more or less readable, but I want more and better skills. I think I just need to continue practing more and more. Practice makes perfect.
